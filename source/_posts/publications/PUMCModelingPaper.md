excerpt: This paper aims to establish a model predicting tennis match volatility and forecasting event outcomes. A Probability-Updatable Markov Chain (PUMC) model based on Support Vector Machines(SVM) is proposed to predict dynamic winning probabilities of each point and conditional winning probabilities of the match at each point.
