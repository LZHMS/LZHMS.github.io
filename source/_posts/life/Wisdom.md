### Chapter 3 Inspiration

#### Human Vision VS Computer Vision

+ Human Vision
  We humans look at one word at a time and scan sentences sequentially: I think that's because a single word in sight triggers our memory, and then we understand it at a glance; We scan a sentence sequentially because of the limited field of view, and although we may have a memory of the sentence, it takes many glances. Therefore, according to our human perception, memory can speed up reading and speed up information processing. The phrase ten lines at a glance is because there is a memory of the corresponding words, and the scanning speed is fast, and the amount of information captured is small.
+ Computer Vision
  Compared with human vision, how can computers also use memory functions to speed up information processing, that is, how computer vision processes information blocks and executes one information block at a time.
