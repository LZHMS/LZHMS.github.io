## Introduction

These days I have been reading the paper *Learning Dexterous In-Hand Manipulation*. And I need to do a acadamic presentation about this paper. To my disappointment, there are no templates of PPTs suitable for concise and precise academic presentation. So utilizing the previous experience, I decide to write the tutorial slides about this paper.
