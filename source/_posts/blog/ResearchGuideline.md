excerpt: This is an article about my participation in Cambridge University Deep Reinforcement Learning Online Study Program.

## I. Introduction

It is a project that leads me to start academic research. What is the most important there is giving me many guidelines about how to find my own ideas.

## II. Guidelines About This Program

### Start My Research Project in Groups

For beginners, there are some very useful suggestions about how to start a research project.

The best method to do research in some aspect would be to aim for a super recent topic.

Research Directions:
We can just combine two things for example: Large Language Model and Deep Reinforcement Learning.

+ Deep Reinforcement Learning $\rightarrow$ Graph Presentation Learning
+ Deep Reinforcement Learning $\rightarrow$ Large Language Model
+ Large Language Model $+$ Graph Presentation Learning

### Methods For Beginners

+ Start with a paper with code;
+ You can change the code and get something new and can also reproduce the results;
+ You can do comparison;
+ A paper may have something interesting that you can put or replace in another paper;

Strategy: go quickly and rank importance according to novelty and code.
After selecting the paper, next thing is to run the code and check if you can reproduce the results. Once you are at that point and then it is easy to make changes and discuss ideas.
After all, if we want to do a very very good research, we need to put forward a simple cool idea on a paper already with code.

### Cooperation in Group

We can go in parallel adding comments and ideas in an overleaf and work on a code.

### Time Allocation

+ Arrange enough time for your goals with different improvement.
