## About Me

Hi, I'm Zhihao Li. This is a brief introduction about me.
I am a junior student at Xidian University, and my favorite research direction is deep learning and large language models. As a new blogger, I am very excited to share with you the learning experience and technical points in the major, and discuss the tricky problems in the technical field together.

## Development Planning

I am a person who has many specific plans about the development of the future. There are two basic principles that I formed in my growth. The one is that I very hate wasting time and the other is that I very advocate gathering my distracted time and energy. Therefore, I develop this module to show my personal plans on my future just as my personal characteristics to be known for you.

+ Development Goal: Become an advanced researcher in some field.
+ First Stage: Determine the research field to be work on in the future (**Spend at least a month, completed**)
+ Second Stage: Prepare myself with enough knowledge to explore about this research field (**Spend at least one or two years, currently working**)
+ Third Stage: Explore as much as possible to find interesting things to promote the scientific research (**Spend as many as possible years, to be completed**)
